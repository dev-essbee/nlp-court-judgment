       "'http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 1 of 2 CASE NO.: Appeal (civil) 1815 of 2008 PETITIONER: M/S TEXMACO LTD. CEMENT DIVISION RESPONDENT: A.S. NARASIMHAM DATE OF JUDGMENT: 07/03/2008 BENCH: ALTAMAS KABIR & J.M. PANCHAL JUDGMENT: JUDGMENT O R D E R CIVIL APPEAL NO. 1815 OF 2008 [Arising out of SLP(C)No. 24836 of 2005] Leave granted. We have heard learned counsel for the parties. It appears that the respondent herein was appointed to look after sales promotion work by the appellant herein with effect from 19th May, 1986. His services were thereafter terminated on 21st September, 1993, but on a representation made by him, he was re-appointed by the appellant and was put on probation for six months. Thereafter, on 20th October, 1994 his probation was extended. Subsequently, by letter dated 20th October, 1994, he was informed that his period of probation would be over on 16th November, 1994, and that thereafter, he would be relieved from service after working hours on the same date. Aggrieved by the said communication, the respondent raised a dispute which was referred to the Industrial Tribunal-cum-Labour Court, Anantpur. The said reference was ultimately dismissed by the learned tribunal, which permitted the respondent to file wri t petition before the Andhra Pradesh High Court. The High Court allowed the writ application and set aside the Award passed by the Labour Court with a direction to the appellant to reinstate the respondent in service as a permanent employee of the company, with continuity of service, attendance benefits and full back-wages. Aggrieved by the said order of the learned Single Judge, the appellant moved the Division Bench of the High Court, which passed an interim order on 16th September, 2005 to the following effect:- \"Heard both sides. There shall be interim suspension pending appeal subject to compliance of Section 17-B of the I.D. Act from the date of the order.\" It is the said interim direction of the Division Bench of the High Court whi ch is the subject matter of the present appeal. Mrs. Maheshwari, learned counsel appearing for the appellant submitted that the High Court had erred in directing that the provisions of Section 17-B of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 be complied with as a condition for grant of stay. According to her, the Section itself indicates that the benefit of the Section would be available only ag ainst an Award of a Labour Court, Tribunal or National Tribunal which is stayed by a higher court. Mrs. Maheshwari further submitted that in addition to the above, the Division Bench of the High Court had also failed to take into consideration the proviso to Section 17-B which provides that either the High Court or the Supreme Court in passing an order under http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 Section 17-B would have to be satisfied that the workmen had not been gainfully employed elsewhere and had not been receiving adequate remuneration during the period in question. Mr. R. Santhan Krishnan, learned counsel appearing for the respondent- workman submitted that the provisions of Section 17-B had to be considered in the spirit in which it was enacted and introduced in the Industrial Disputes Act, namely, to provide a means of subsistence to the workmen during the period when the Award made in his favour stood suspended by way of challenge before the higher forum. According to him though the provisions of Section 17-B may not strictly apply in respect of an order of reinstatement passed by the High Court, this Court had in the case of Dena Bank Vs. Kiritkumar T. Patel, 1999(2)SCC-106, held that the powers of the High Court and the Supreme Court under Articles 226 and 136 of the Constitution were not in any way restricted to the provisions of Section 17-B of the Industrial Disputes Act, but that both the High Court and the Supreme Court could give directions which were similar to those contained in Section 17-B to provide interim relief to the workmen during the pendency of a challenge to the Award made in his favour. He also referred to another decision in the case of Dena Bank Vs. Ghanshyam, 2001 (5)SCC 169, where the earlier judgment had been followed. Having considered the submissions made on behalf of the respective parties, although, we agree with the submissions made by Mrs. Maheshwari that Section 17-B of the Industrial Disputes Act would not strictly apply in the fact situation of this case, we al so agree with Mr. Krishnan that this Court under Article 136 of the Constitution has the power to grant relief similar to that contemplated under Section 17-B of the Industrial Disputes Act, since the object of Section 17-B, as indicated hereinbefore, is to provide interim rel ief to the workman, who has an Award in his favour and which Award is challenged before the higher forum to prevent its implementation. We, accordingly, see no reason to interfere with the order passed by the Division Bench of the High Court under appeal, but we also make it clear that the spirit of Section 1 7- B of the Industrial Disputes Act has to be maintained as a whole and, accordingly, whatever relief is granted in terms of the directions given by the Division Bench of the High Court must also take into consideration the proviso to Section 17-B of the aforesaid Act. The appeal is accordingly disposed of. There will be no orders as to costs. This order will be operative from the date of the order of reinstatement pas sed by the learned Single Judge of the High Court.'"

The prayer reads as follows :-\\n\\x0c                                          2\\n\\n        “It is therefore prayed that the contempt\\n        proceedings          may    please         be    intiated         and\\n        the contemnors be punished according to\\n        law and the order of revival passed by\\n        the Arbitrator may please be stayed.”\\n\\n\\n\\n4.    The Court of Small Causes treated the application\\n\\nfiled     by     the     respondent           as        an     application           for\\n\\ncontempt       without       mentioning        any       provision.             It   is\\n\\nalso significant to note that even the applicant had\\n\\nnot mentioned any provision for initiating contempt.\\n\\nThe     Court    passed        an    order           dated       06.11.2013          by\\n\\nentering a finding that there is no contempt and that\\n\\nthere is no violation of the order dated 22.06.2011.\\n\\nThe operative portion of the order, to the extent\\n\\nrelevant, reads as follows :-\\n\\n         “The     proceedings            of        the        arbitration\\n         continued by the Arbitrator, is based on\\n         the understanding of the Arbitrator and\\n         the learned counsel for the defendants as\\n         to the correct import of the order dated\\n         22-06-2011.               The        said       understanding\\n         arrived at, though is borne out from the\\n         facts and circumstances pertaining to the\\n         controversy,          cannot          be       construed          as\\n         willful       and    deliberate            attempt          on   the\\n         part of counsel for parties involved, to\\n         flout     the       order       of     the          court    dated\\n         22-06-2011.          The arbitration proceedings\\n         is an independent and statutory remedy\\n         available under the provisions of Jammu\\n         and Kashmir Arbitration Act, 2002.                               The\\n\\x0c                                    3\\n\\nprovisions of said Act have overriding\\neffect over the general laws.                          Exercise\\nof statutory remedy and proceedings under\\nthe special act, cannot be scuttled in\\nordinary course of events.                       Only if the\\nstatute      provides          for       such    exercise         of\\npower by the civil court, the civil court\\ncan     enter      into        the       domain        of        such\\njurisdiction, that too in limited sphere.\\n     The   exercise        of       jurisdiction            by   the\\nArbitrator,            available                 under            the\\nprovisions           of        Jammu            and      Kashmir\\nArbitration Act, advise rendered by the\\nlearned         counsel              representing                 the\\ndefendant       in    the       court       or       before      the\\nArbitrator, and proceedings initiated by\\nany party in exercise of statutory right,\\ncannot be construed as flouting of the\\norder of the civil court or willful or\\ndeliberate violation of the order, unless\\nthe     violation         is    clear,          emphatic         and\\napparently willful and deliberate, aimed\\nat    defeating       the       order       passed       by      the\\ncourt.       From      the      nature          of    the    order\\npassed by the court of Sub-Judge/Judge\\nSmall      Causes     Court,            Srinagar,      and       the\\nfacts and circumstances pertaining to the\\ncase, I find no flouting or violation of\\nthe     order        dated      22.06.2011,             by       the\\npersons         named           in         the         contempt\\napplication.                   No        justifiable             and\\nsufficient ground exists for proceedings\\nagainst      the       said         named        persons         for\\ncontempt      of      court.             Accordingly,            the\\ncontempt proceedings are dropped against\\n\\x0c                                         4\\n\\n      the said named persons.                      Application is\\n      dismissed.          Record of application be made\\n      part of suit file on completion.”\\n\\n\\n\\n5.    That    order       was    challenged             by    the    respondent\\n\\nbefore the High Court.            The High Court has considered\\n\\nthe matter in extenso.             At paragraphs 11, 13 and 17,\\n\\nthe High Court has entered its findings as follows :-\\n\\n      “11. Admittedly, the impugned order has\\n      been passed by the learned Sub-Judge in\\n      a      contempt       petition              filed        by     the\\n      petitioner.                The     Jammu          and    Kashmir\\n      Contempt of Courts Act, 1997 (Act No.\\n      XXV     of   1997)        (for     short,         Contempt      of\\n      Courts Act) was enacted to define and\\n      limit     the       power    of        certain         courts   in\\n      punishing       contempt           of       courts       and     to\\n      regulate        their       procedure             in    relation\\n      thereto.        There is no provision in this\\n      Act to empower a subordinate court to\\n      punish       contempt        of        itself.          However,\\n      Section 10 of the Contempt of Courts Act\\n      vests with the High Court the power to\\n      punish contempts of subordinate courts.\\n      It says that the High Court shall have\\n      and     exercise           the     same       jurisdiction,\\n      powers and authority in accordance with\\n      the     same     procedure             and    practice,          in\\n      respect         of         contempts              of      courts\\n      subordinate           to     it        as     it        has     and\\n      exercises       in        respect       of    contempts          of\\n      itself;      provided            that       the    High       Court\\n      shall not take congnizance of a contempt\\n      alleged        to     have        been        committed         in\\n\\x0c                                5\\n\\nrespect    of     a     court       subordinate         to    it\\nwhere     such        contempt         is     an      offence\\npunishable under the Ranbir Penal Code,\\n1989.      Thus, the law provides that if\\nthere      is        contempt          of      any        court\\nsubordinate to the High Court, it is the\\nHigh Court alone which has the power to\\npunish for such contempt.                     Essentially,\\ntherefore,       a     court     subordinate            to   the\\nHigh    Court     cannot        take    cognizance           and\\ninitiate        proceedings            to     punish         for\\ncontempt     of        itself,       the      question        of\\nconducting trial of an application for\\ncontempt and taking a decision thereon\\nis far remote.\\n\\n\\n13. Since the subordinate courts do not\\nhave the jurisdiction to take cognizance\\nof     contempt        of      itself,       or      initiate\\nproceedings       on       a   contempt       petition        or\\ntry it, it cannot proceed to decide it\\nfinally.          In     the     instant          case,      the\\nlearned    Sub-Judge           has     not     only       taken\\ncognizance           but       has       proceeded            to\\ninitiate,        and        conducted,         proceedings\\nthereon and finally decided it.                       Thereby\\nthe     learned        Sub-Judge        has       assumed      a\\njurisdiction,          not     vested       in     it     under\\nlaw.\\n\\n\\n17. During the course of arguments of\\nthis case, the learned counsel for the\\npetitioner brought it to the notice of\\nthe Court that the Arbitrator appointed\\nin violation of the ad-interim orders of\\n\\x0c                                           6\\n\\n       the trial court has ultimately concluded\\n       the    proceedings            and       passed    the        final\\n       award     against           the         interests      of       the\\n       petitioner.                Pending       decision          in   the\\n       contempt petition in terms of applicable\\n       laws,    there          shall       be     stay       of    final\\n       award.        It hardly needs a mention here\\n       that in the event it is found that there\\n       has    been       a     violation         of    the        interim\\n       order        of         the        trial        court,          the\\n       appointment           of    the     Arbitrator         and      the\\n       proceedings           conducted          by    him     together\\n       with any award passed by him would be\\n       rendered non-est in the eyes of law.”\\n\\n\\n\\n6.   When the matter came up before this Court, the\\n\\nfollowing order was passed on 18.04.2016 :-\\n\\n       “Though we do not have any quarrel with\\n       the settled position of law, as held by\\n       the High Court that the trial court does\\n       not    have       any      jurisdiction          to    initiate\\n       proceedings under the Jammu and Kashmir\\n       Contempt of Courts Act, 1997, we find\\n       that the High Court has omitted to take\\n       note    of    the       fact       that       there    are      two\\n       separate          proceedings             under       different\\n       contracts.\\n       In     that       view        of    the       matter,       issue\\n       notice.\\n       In the meantime, there shall be stay of\\n       further       proceedings               pursuant       to       the\\n       impugned order.”\\n\\x0c                                      7\\n\\n7.     Having heard Mr. Tushar Mehta, learned Additional\\n\\nSolicitor General, and Mr. Abdul Rehman, representing\\n\\nthe    respondent      on    permission,        we     do    not    feel    it\\n\\nnecessary     to     refer    to    any    other      factual       details.\\n\\nThough an application for contempt was filed before\\n\\nthe trial court, it was, in fact, a petition for\\n\\ntaking action under Order XXXIX Rule 2A of Jammu and\\n\\nKashmir Code of Civil Procedure Act, 1977.                         It is not\\n\\na case for initiating contempt on the face of it.\\n\\nThese are two different jurisdictions.                        That is all\\n\\nthat    has   been    clarified       by   the       High    Court.        The\\n\\nappeal    is,   hence,       disposed      of    with       the    following\\n\\ndirections :-\\n\\ni)      The   application       filed      by    the    respondent         for\\n\\ninitiating         contempt        shall    be        treated        as     an\\n\\napplication for taking action under Order XXXIX Rule\\n\\n2A of the Jammu and Kashmir Code of Civil Procedure.\\n\\nIt shall be renumbered accordingly.\\n\\nii)    The trial court shall first see whether there is\\n\\nany disobedience of the order of injunction and in\\n\\ncase the court enters a finding of disobedience, the\\n\\nrest under Order XXXIX Rule 2A alone shall follow.\\n\\n\\n\\n8.     The submission made by the appellants regarding\\n\\nseparate      contracts       and    pending         application       under\\n\\nSection 8 of the Jammu and Kashmir Arbitration Act\\n\\netc. are open to the appellants to canvas before the\\n\\x0c                                 8\\n\\ntrial court at the appropriate stage.              It will also\\n\\nbe   open   to   the   respondent    to   take    all   available\\n\\ncontentions before the trial court.              Being a matter\\n\\npending since long, we direct the trial court to take\\n\\na    decision      accordingly       on     the     application\\n\\nexpeditiously and preferably within a period of three\\n\\nmonths from the date of receipt of a copy of this\\n\\nJudgment.\\n\\n     No costs.\\n\\n                                     .......................J.\\n                                            [ KURIAN JOSEPH ]\\n\\n\\n                                   .......................J.\\n                                 [ MOHAN M.
